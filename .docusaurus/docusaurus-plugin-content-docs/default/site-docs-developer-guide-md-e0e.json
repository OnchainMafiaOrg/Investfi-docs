  "description": "Integrate a transaction fee mechanism where a 1% fee is levied on each transaction. Half of this fee is redistributed to $MEMA holders, while a portion goes towards liquidity provision, and the remainder is used for token buyback and burn. This will be managed through smart contracts that automatically execute these operations with each transaction.",
