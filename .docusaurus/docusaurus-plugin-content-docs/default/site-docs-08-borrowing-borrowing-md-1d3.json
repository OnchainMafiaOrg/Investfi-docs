  "description": "The MEME Mafia platform will introduce a cross-token staking mechanism allowing users to stake various tokens from the ecosystem, such as \"Turtle Papa\" and others, to earn $MEMA tokens. This approach involves developing a flexible and secure staking smart contract capable of handling multiple types of tokens as inputs for staking and managing the distribution of $MEMA as rewards.",
